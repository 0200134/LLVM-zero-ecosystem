# 🪶 LLVM-Zero Manifesto  
> *“This is the age of compiler sovereignty.”*

## We Believe Compilers Should Be

- **Understandable** — readable, teachable, explainable.  
- **Buildable by individuals** — anyone can rebuild it from source.  
- **Free from hidden dependencies** — clarity over convenience.  
- **Capable of teaching, not just translating** — a compiler should reveal its logic.

> This is the age of **compiler sovereignty** —  
> where developers reclaim the right to understand their own tools.

## 🧠 Understandable
A compiler must be readable, explainable, and self-contained.  
Its internals should teach — not intimidate.  
No opaque layers, no “black box” IR.

---

### 🧱 Buildable by Individuals
Anyone with a C++ compiler and curiosity should be able to rebuild it.  
No monolithic dependencies, no multi-gigabyte toolchains.  
If one person can’t compile it, it isn’t freedom.

---

### 🔓 Free from Hidden Dependencies
Every line should be traceable.  
Every artifact should be reproducible.  
True zero-dependency means **clarity, not isolation**.

---

### 🧩 Capable of Teaching, Not Just Translating
A compiler should explain *why*, not only *how*.  
It’s not just a translator — it’s a textbook encoded in code.  
A living reference for future engineers.

---

## ⚙️ Our Goal
To design a full compiler pipeline —  
**C++ → Rust → ASM** —  
that breathes without LLVM, Clang, or opaque runtime layers.  
Readable IR. Deterministic builds.  
Code that lives longer than its dependencies.

---

## 🧭 Our Ethos
- **Transparency over abstraction**  
- **Simplicity over bureaucracy**  
- **Understanding over automation**

---

## ❤️ Declaration
> “We do not reject LLVM.  
> We simply believe compilers deserve independence —  
> the right to evolve, to teach, and to be rebuilt by anyone.”
