# ⚙️ LLVM-Zero Architecture
> “The architecture of independence.”

---

## 1. Overview
LLVM-Zero is structured as an **open compiler coordination layer**,  
defining how tools like R3C, cpppm, and Rust-LTSS interact transparently.

---

## 2. Layered Structure
| Layer | Function | Implementation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| 🧱 Core | Language transpilation (C++↔Rust) | R3C |
| 🔗 ABI Layer | Open Post-LLVM ABI schema | In research |
| ⚙️ Build Layer | Cross-platform manager (cpppm) | Stable |
| 🦀 Sustain Layer | Long-term Rust toolchain (LTSS) | Planned |
| 🪶 Docs Layer | LLVM-Zero coordination | Active |

---

## 3. Technical Flow
[C++] → [R3C] ↔ [Rust] → [LLVM-Zero ABI] → [ASM] ↓ [cpppm Build Layer]

---

## 4. Integration Goals
- Define ABI boundary spec between LLVM-Zero and Rust  
- Automate build artifact introspection  
- Establish dependency-free testing harness  

---

🧩 LLVM-Zero — *transparent pipelines for autonomous compilers.*
