# 🪶 LLVM-Zero Philosophy  
> “Dependence is comfort. Independence is evolution.”

---

## 1. Vision
LLVM-Zero is not a rebellion — it’s a divergence.  
It seeks to create **compilers that understand themselves**,  
free from layered abstraction and opaque backends.

---

## 2. Principles
| Principle | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| Zero-Dependency | Remove forced reliance on LLVM for backend generation |
| Transparency | Toolchains should be inspectable and explainable |
| Modularity | Each layer (C++, Rust, ASM) communicates through open interfaces |
| Autonomy | The compiler breathes on its own — no shadow infrastructure |

---

## 3. Philosophy Keywords
- Zero Waste of Abstraction  
- Zero Fear of Simplicity  
- Zero Barrier to Evolution

> “The best abstraction is the one you can see through.”

---

## 4. Ecosystem View
LLVM-Zero bridges philosophy with practice:
- **R3C** — implementation proof of independence  
- **Rust-LTSS** — sustainability layer  
- **Nightly LTSS** — experimental evolution path

---

## 5. Closing
> “A compiler that depends on another is not yet alive.”  
🧩 LLVM-Zero — *independence as engineering.*
